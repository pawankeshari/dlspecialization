Deep Learning Specialization

This course has been completed on Coursera offerred by deeplearning.ai. In this specialization we have implemented different algorithms from the core in python.

The codes have written in Jupyter notebook.

In First Week: We have implemented Deep Neural Network using logistic regression. We will be finally building a deep neural network for Cat classifier.

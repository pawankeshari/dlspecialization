Deep Learning Specialization

This course has been completed on Coursera offered by deeplearning.ai. In this specialization we have implemented different algorithms from the core in python.

This course has enabled us to develop, analyze large and complex datasets. Also create systems that adapt and improve over time, and build intelligent applications that can make predictions from data.

The codes have written in Jupyter notebook.

In First Week: We have implemented Deep Neural Network using logistic regression. We will be finally building a deep neural network for Cat classifier.
